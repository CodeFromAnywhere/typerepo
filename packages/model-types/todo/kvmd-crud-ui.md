# KeyValueMarkdownModelType CRUD UI

Wouldn't it be amazing to create a ui where you can update the categories in a very good UI?

- View it as a upside-down tree where the header level is the branch level, zoomable.
- Create by just clicking '+' next to a level or below an item/category to either make a sibling or children
- Update items (changing key/value/comment) by clicking on them (this can make it editable)
- Deleting items (with all their children) with a simple delete button

I think it is relatively easy to do this. It will probably not take more than 4 hours. I can use these categories for all kinds of things. Markdown is easy enough for me of course, but this makes the overview more clear and easier to update through an admin. Once I have this I can start creating categories for all kinds of things. This could be amazing! Passionfruit will also love it.
