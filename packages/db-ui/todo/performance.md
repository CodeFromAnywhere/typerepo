Areas that we have to take a look at:

- why is it slow, what takes the most time?
- can these time consuming things be improved? at which level is the easiest?
- will a better server (more cpu) decrease loading time enough?
- can I do something smart with caching? I guess this will make it much faster in consecutive times
