Offline `search` would be great:

- create a `md` index in `.index` with all headlines + level, splitting up camelCase words
- create a `getStaticProps` prop for search strings with their path
- make a search bar that can search through that in real time
- on backend-driven things, this function can be passed through an endpoint as well
