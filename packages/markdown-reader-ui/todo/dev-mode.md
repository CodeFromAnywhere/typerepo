## DEV settings

Add an local env variable that is used in `__DEV__` mode that uses a different base directory for the docs. Maybe I can even make an admin page that just fetches all `BundleSummary`'s with all modules, packages and docs, and then renders that. This way I can show these reader-ui's for different bundles while still creating them.
