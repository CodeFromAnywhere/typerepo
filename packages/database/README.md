#### Parameter 2: customQueryConfig (optional): object

> NB: the dbStorageMethod cannot be specified here because this is a static configuration per db-model and cannot be specified on a per-query basis.<br /><br />Also you can't specify projectRelativePath and operationRelativePath. It should not be needed, you should specify the db storage locations in the createDb config.

No problem.<br /><br />Therefore, let's store all time values in the format Date.now()                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| id                               | string | Should be an unique string By default, you can use `generateId()` to generate a random string of 16 characters. If you wish, you can also use any other string, as long as you are sure it's unique.<br /><br /># Background Info<br /><br />azAZ09 characters are easy to copy and provide 62 characters. the goal of an id is to be unique.<br /><br />the advantage of a random id compared to an numeric id starting with 1 with auto increment is that you can set them up decentralised.<br /><br />the change of duplicate ids gets bigger once you make them shorter the change of finding an existing id gets bigger once you make them shorter<br /><br />An Id with 12 characters would provide 3.22e21 combinations.<br /><br />What is the change of duplicate ids? This depends on the amount of identifyable items in the data What is the change of guessing an id? This depends on speed of a brute force attack and the amount of available datapoints. If you can guess 10000 times per second, you can make 864.000.000 guesses. A billion guesses on a dataset of a billion datapoints yields 3226 correct ids on average.<br /><br />Why make an id short? I don't know if there's an important reason.<br /><br />All in all, I think we should make ids 24 characters by default. This would make it very easy to store, yet, with more than E42 combinations, make it nearly impossible to get duplication or brute force hits.<br /><br />An id would look like this:<br /><br />`{ "id": "sk2EcW9AkZpksk2EcW9AkZpk" }`<br /><br />Looks good to me! Don't think about it and just keep it simple. We can always migrate later to a bigger amount, but I don't see good reason to keep it smaller than this. |

No problem.<br /><br />Therefore, let's store all time values in the format Date.now()                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| id                               | string  | Should be an unique string By default, you can use `generateId()` to generate a random string of 16 characters. If you wish, you can also use any other string, as long as you are sure it's unique.<br /><br /># Background Info<br /><br />azAZ09 characters are easy to copy and provide 62 characters. the goal of an id is to be unique.<br /><br />the advantage of a random id compared to an numeric id starting with 1 with auto increment is that you can set them up decentralised.<br /><br />the change of duplicate ids gets bigger once you make them shorter the change of finding an existing id gets bigger once you make them shorter<br /><br />An Id with 12 characters would provide 3.22e21 combinations.<br /><br />What is the change of duplicate ids? This depends on the amount of identifyable items in the data What is the change of guessing an id? This depends on speed of a brute force attack and the amount of available datapoints. If you can guess 10000 times per second, you can make 864.000.000 guesses. A billion guesses on a dataset of a billion datapoints yields 3226 correct ids on average.<br /><br />Why make an id short? I don't know if there's an important reason.<br /><br />All in all, I think we should make ids 24 characters by default. This would make it very easy to store, yet, with more than E42 combinations, make it nearly impossible to get duplication or brute force hits.<br /><br />An id would look like this:<br /><br />`{ "id": "sk2EcW9AkZpksk2EcW9AkZpk" }`<br /><br />Looks good to me! Don't think about it and just keep it simple. We can always migrate later to a bigger amount, but I don't see good reason to keep it smaller than this. |

| createdAt                        | number | Time<br /><br />Time can be stored in various ways but in my experience it is, again, best to keep it simple and just have one way to store time.

| id                               | string | Should be an unique string By default, you can use `generateId()` to generate a random string of 16 characters. If you wish, you can also use any other string, as long as you are sure it's unique.<br /><br /># Background Info<br /><br />azAZ09 characters are easy to copy and provide 62 characters. the goal of an id is to be unique.<br /><br />the advantage of a random id compared to an numeric id starting with 1 with auto increment is that you can set them up decentralised.<br /><br />the change of duplicate ids gets bigger once you make them shorter the change of finding an existing id gets bigger once you make them shorter<br /><br />An Id with 12 characters would provide 3.22e21 combinations.<br /><br />What is the change of duplicate ids? This depends on the amount of identifyable items in the data What is the change of guessing an id? This depends on speed of a brute force attack and the amount of available datapoints. If you can guess 10000 times per second, you can make 864.000.000 guesses. A billion guesses on a dataset of a billion datapoints yields 3226 correct ids on average.<br /><br />Why make an id short? I don't know if there's an important reason.<br /><br />All in all, I think we should make ids 24 characters by default. This would make it very easy to store, yet, with more than E42 combinations, make it nearly impossible to get duplication or brute force hits.<br /><br />An id would look like this:<br /><br />`{ "id": "sk2EcW9AkZpksk2EcW9AkZpk" }`<br /><br />Looks good to me! Don't think about it and just keep it simple. We can always migrate later to a bigger amount, but I don't see good reason to keep it smaller than this. |

## CustomQueryConfig

NB: the dbStorageMethod cannot be specified here because this is a static configuration per db-model and cannot be specified on a per-query basis.

Also you can't specify projectRelativePath and operationRelativePath. It should not be needed, you should specify the db storage locations in the createDb config.

| createdAt                        | number | Time<br /><br />Time can be stored in various ways but in my experience it is, again, best to keep it simple and just have one way to store time. I can think about this for hours, but my intuition goes towards using the same format as Date.now() because it is a very small format and is easy to read.<br /><br />It is the amount of ms since 1970.<br /><br />I could argue to store it in seconds since 1970 since there are few applications of doing ms, but maybe we do, and it's just 30% bigger. No problem.<br /><br />Therefore, let's store all time values in the format Date.now()                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| id                               | string | Should be an unique string By default, you can use `generateId()` to generate a random string of 16 characters. If you wish, you can also use any other string, as long as you are sure it's unique.<br /><br /># Background Info<br /><br />azAZ09 characters are easy to copy and provide 62 characters. the goal of an id is to be unique.<br /><br />the advantage of a random id compared to an numeric id starting with 1 with auto increment is that you can set them up decentralised.<br /><br />the change of duplicate ids gets bigger once you make them shorter the change of finding an existing id gets bigger once you make them shorter<br /><br />An Id with 12 characters would provide 3.22e21 combinations.<br /><br />What is the change of duplicate ids? This depends on the amount of identifyable items in the data What is the change of guessing an id? This depends on speed of a brute force attack and the amount of available datapoints. If you can guess 10000 times per second, you can make 864.000.000 guesses. A billion guesses on a dataset of a billion datapoints yields 3226 correct ids on average.<br /><br />Why make an id short? I don't know if there's an important reason.<br /><br />All in all, I think we should make ids 24 characters by default. This would make it very easy to store, yet, with more than E42 combinations, make it nearly impossible to get duplication or brute force hits.<br /><br />An id would look like this:<br /><br />`{ "id": "sk2EcW9AkZpksk2EcW9AkZpk" }`<br /><br />Looks good to me! Don't think about it and just keep it simple. We can always migrate later to a bigger amount, but I don't see good reason to keep it smaller than this. |

## KeyValueMarkdownModelType

handy model type for storing stuff in a KeyValue Markdown file. empty lines are omitted

all you need to specify in the kvmd is the key and the value, separated by ":"

NB: there can be a `parent_modelNameSlug` key exposed that should refer to the parent slug

## MarkdownModelType

Handy model type for storing stuff in a Markdown file.

1 markdown file will represent 1 MarkdownModelType extended instance

another option could be to parse the markdown file, but to KISS we are going to just return markdown with the full markdown content

No problem.<br /><br />Therefore, let's store all time values in the format Date.now()                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| id                               | string | Should be an unique string By default, you can use `generateId()` to generate a random string of 16 characters. If you wish, you can also use any other string, as long as you are sure it's unique.<br /><br /># Background Info<br /><br />azAZ09 characters are easy to copy and provide 62 characters. the goal of an id is to be unique.<br /><br />the advantage of a random id compared to an numeric id starting with 1 with auto increment is that you can set them up decentralised.<br /><br />the change of duplicate ids gets bigger once you make them shorter the change of finding an existing id gets bigger once you make them shorter<br /><br />An Id with 12 characters would provide 3.22e21 combinations.<br /><br />What is the change of duplicate ids? This depends on the amount of identifyable items in the data What is the change of guessing an id? This depends on speed of a brute force attack and the amount of available datapoints. If you can guess 10000 times per second, you can make 864.000.000 guesses. A billion guesses on a dataset of a billion datapoints yields 3226 correct ids on average.<br /><br />Why make an id short? I don't know if there's an important reason.<br /><br />All in all, I think we should make ids 24 characters by default. This would make it very easy to store, yet, with more than E42 combinations, make it nearly impossible to get duplication or brute force hits.<br /><br />An id would look like this:<br /><br />`{ "id": "sk2EcW9AkZpksk2EcW9AkZpk" }`<br /><br />Looks good to me! Don't think about it and just keep it simple. We can always migrate later to a bigger amount, but I don't see good reason to keep it smaller than this. |

## OperationConfig

anything configurable about the operation.

Of course we could make this live in operation.json or as a prop in package.json, but it would be better to make it work with a markdown file.

Let's try to use OPERATION.md

TODO: Make this work and make sure the operationconfig is parsed from this file using `db.get("OperationConfig")` as per convention.

| id                               | string | Should be an unique string By default, you can use `generateId()` to generate a random string of 16 characters. If you wish, you can also use any other string, as long as you are sure it's unique.<br /><br /># Background Info<br /><br />azAZ09 characters are easy to copy and provide 62 characters. the goal of an id is to be unique.<br /><br />the advantage of a random id compared to an numeric id starting with 1 with auto increment is that you can set them up decentralised.<br /><br />the change of duplicate ids gets bigger once you make them shorter the change of finding an existing id gets bigger once you make them shorter<br /><br />An Id with 12 characters would provide 3.22e21 combinations.<br /><br />What is the change of duplicate ids? This depends on the amount of identifyable items in the data What is the change of guessing an id? This depends on speed of a brute force attack and the amount of available datapoints. If you can guess 10000 times per second, you can make 864.000.000 guesses. A billion guesses on a dataset of a billion datapoints yields 3226 correct ids on average.<br /><br />Why make an id short? I don't know if there's an important reason.<br /><br />All in all, I think we should make ids 24 characters by default. This would make it very easy to store, yet, with more than E42 combinations, make it nearly impossible to get duplication or brute force hits.<br /><br />An id would look like this:<br /><br />`{ "id": "sk2EcW9AkZpksk2EcW9AkZpk" }`<br /><br />Looks good to me! Don't think about it and just keep it simple. We can always migrate later to a bigger amount, but I don't see good reason to keep it smaller than this. |

I can think about this for hours, but my intuition goes towards using the same format as Date.now() because it is a very small format and is easy to read.<br /><br />It is the amount of ms since 1970.<br /><br />I could argue to store it in seconds since 1970 since there are few applications of doing ms, but maybe we do, and it's just 30% bigger. No problem.<br /><br />Therefore, let's store all time values in the format Date.now()                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| id                               | string  | Should be an unique string By default, you can use `generateId()` to generate a random string of 16 characters. If you wish, you can also use any other string, as long as you are sure it's unique.<br /><br /># Background Info<br /><br />azAZ09 characters are easy to copy and provide 62 characters. the goal of an id is to be unique.<br /><br />the advantage of a random id compared to an numeric id starting with 1 with auto increment is that you can set them up decentralised.<br /><br />the change of duplicate ids gets bigger once you make them shorter the change of finding an existing id gets bigger once you make them shorter<br /><br />An Id with 12 characters would provide 3.22e21 combinations.<br /><br />What is the change of duplicate ids? This depends on the amount of identifyable items in the data What is the change of guessing an id? This depends on speed of a brute force attack and the amount of available datapoints. If you can guess 10000 times per second, you can make 864.000.000 guesses. A billion guesses on a dataset of a billion datapoints yields 3226 correct ids on average.<br /><br />Why make an id short? I don't know if there's an important reason.<br /><br />All in all, I think we should make ids 24 characters by default. This would make it very easy to store, yet, with more than E42 combinations, make it nearly impossible to get duplication or brute force hits.<br /><br />An id would look like this:<br /><br />`{ "id": "sk2EcW9AkZpksk2EcW9AkZpk" }`<br /><br />Looks good to me! Don't think about it and just keep it simple. We can always migrate later to a bigger amount, but I don't see good reason to keep it smaller than this. |

| id                               | string | Should be an unique string By default, you can use `generateId()` to generate a random string of 16 characters. If you wish, you can also use any other string, as long as you are sure it's unique.<br /><br /># Background Info<br /><br />azAZ09 characters are easy to copy and provide 62 characters. the goal of an id is to be unique.<br /><br />the advantage of a random id compared to an numeric id starting with 1 with auto increment is that you can set them up decentralised.<br /><br />the change of duplicate ids gets bigger once you make them shorter the change of finding an existing id gets bigger once you make them shorter<br /><br />An Id with 12 characters would provide 3.22e21 combinations.<br /><br />What is the change of duplicate ids? This depends on the amount of identifyable items in the data What is the change of guessing an id? This depends on speed of a brute force attack and the amount of available datapoints. If you can guess 10000 times per second, you can make 864.000.000 guesses. A billion guesses on a dataset of a billion datapoints yields 3226 correct ids on average.<br /><br />Why make an id short? I don't know if there's an important reason.<br /><br />All in all, I think we should make ids 24 characters by default. This would make it very easy to store, yet, with more than E42 combinations, make it nearly impossible to get duplication or brute force hits.<br /><br />An id would look like this:<br /><br />`{ "id": "sk2EcW9AkZpksk2EcW9AkZpk" }`<br /><br />Looks good to me! Don't think about it and just keep it simple. We can always migrate later to a bigger amount, but I don't see good reason to keep it smaller than this. |

| id                               | string | Should be an unique string By default, you can use `generateId()` to generate a random string of 16 characters. If you wish, you can also use any other string, as long as you are sure it's unique.<br /><br /># Background Info<br /><br />azAZ09 characters are easy to copy and provide 62 characters. the goal of an id is to be unique.<br /><br />the advantage of a random id compared to an numeric id starting with 1 with auto increment is that you can set them up decentralised.<br /><br />the change of duplicate ids gets bigger once you make them shorter the change of finding an existing id gets bigger once you make them shorter<br /><br />An Id with 12 characters would provide 3.22e21 combinations.<br /><br />What is the change of duplicate ids? This depends on the amount of identifyable items in the data What is the change of guessing an id? This depends on speed of a brute force attack and the amount of available datapoints. If you can guess 10000 times per second, you can make 864.000.000 guesses. A billion guesses on a dataset of a billion datapoints yields 3226 correct ids on average.<br /><br />Why make an id short? I don't know if there's an important reason.<br /><br />All in all, I think we should make ids 24 characters by default. This would make it very easy to store, yet, with more than E42 combinations, make it nearly impossible to get duplication or brute force hits.<br /><br />An id would look like this:<br /><br />`{ "id": "sk2EcW9AkZpksk2EcW9AkZpk" }`<br /><br />Looks good to me! Don't think about it and just keep it simple. We can always migrate later to a bigger amount, but I don't see good reason to keep it smaller than this. |
