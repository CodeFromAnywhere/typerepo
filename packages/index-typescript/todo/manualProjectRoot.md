# Dev manualProjectRoot

Make `manualProjectRoot` work for `dev` and all subfunctions

Make it a setting you can specify in the first param of the cli, but if you don't specify it, have it use the last used parameter. Show this on startup.

Confirm the `dev` works outside of project into the project (start using that myself as well)
