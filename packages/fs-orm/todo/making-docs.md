# Documentation

All interfaces should be in README when generating it, not only db-interfaces. They should be separated though.

Write about the different levels where data can be stored, and the different storage methods. Attach as much as possible to the functions instead of creating separate docs.

Use `OPERATION.md` for usage and description.

Docs:

- makeDb and the resulting db object (write manually!)

Guides:

- validating your database data (the different approaches)
- migrating your data to new data structures (the different approaches)
- performance
- concurrency
