# Functions

## generateNamedIndex

Generates an index.ts file based on named statements in the operation. Also generates test array. Not used currently.

NB: This overwrites the indexfile of the operation in the src folder! Make sure you don't have anything there still.. All functions should be in other filenames.

Should be ran every time an operation changes




### Parameters (1)

#### Parameter 1: {  operationName,  manualProjectRoot,}: object

Properties: 

 | Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| manualProjectRoot (optional) | string |  |
| operationName  | string |  |



## generateSimpleIndex

generates operation index and writes it to index.ts in src of the operation.

NB: This overwrites the indexfile of the operation in the src folder! Make sure you don't have anything there still.. All functions should be in other filenames.

Should be ran every time an operation changes

## TsFunction

Interface for arrow functions and normal functions



> --- dbStorageMethod: jsonSingle<br />---<br /><br />Interface for arrow functions and normal functions

Properties: 

 | Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| operationName  | null | name of operation the model belongs to<br /><br />- calculated value (not stored in database)<br />- can be `null` or an actual operationName that it was saved at<br />- can be `undefined` when you are creating an item, because then it can be set for you |
| projectRelativePath  | string | path to dbfile<br /><br />- calculated value (not stored in database)<br />- relatively from the project (without slash at start)<br />- can be `undefined` when you are creating an item, because then it can be set for you |
| operationRelativePath (optional) | string | path to db file<br /><br />- relatively from the operation root folder (without slash at start)<br />- calculated value (not stored in database)<br />- can be `undefined` if the db file does not belong to an operation<br />- can be `undefined` when you are creating an item, because then it can be set for you |
| id  | string | unique id of the model |
| name  | string | name (identifier) of the model |
| slug  | string | kebab-case variant of the name |
| operationRelativeTypescriptFilePath  | string | relative file path from the operation that this indexed instance is referencing to<br /><br />e.g. src/general.ts<br /><br />(no preceding slash) |
| isExported  | boolean | The function is immediately exported upon creation. If the os dev tools are being used, this means it is also exported from the operation |
| isApiExposed  | boolean | for all exported functions in node operations, true by default false for others<br /><br />can be overwritten using frontmatter |
| apiAuthenticationStrategy  | string | Still not sure if the user one is a good idea but there are probably some usecases that would really benefit to have a user-layer embedded in the king os system |
| description (optional) | string | a string that is known to contain markdown. |
| rawText (optional) | string | raw text of the function |
| commentsInside  | array | all comments found in a function and the node that they belong to |
| returnType  | object | all info that should always be collected when indexing any type interface |
| parameters (optional) | array | parameters the function takes as its arguments, if any |
| size  | object | type interface that can be used to summarize multiple files |
| commentSize (optional) | object | type interface that can be used to summarize multiple files |
| codeSize (optional) | object | type interface that can be used to summarize multiple files |
| cumulativeSize (optional) | object | type interface that can be used to summarize multiple files |
| cumulativeCommentSize (optional) | object | type interface that can be used to summarize multiple files |
| cumulativeCodeSize (optional) | object | type interface that can be used to summarize multiple files |
| maxIndentationDepth  | number | maximum amount of times indedented in this function<br /><br />good for determining the complexity and finding code that can be simplified/destructured into smaller pieces |
| dependantFiles (optional) | array | finds all files that import this function<br /><br />NB: this is not indexed because this information has nothing to do with the operation itself, but the exposure to the broader monorepo. This is calculated on the fly. |



## TsInterface

TODO: Just like parameters, this should be linted for. If you define an interface that's not declared here, that should ring a bell.

| id  | string | unique id of the model |

| operationRelativeTypescriptFilePath  | string | relative file path from the operation that this indexed instance is referencing to<br /><br />e.g. src/general.ts<br /><br />(no preceding slash) |
| type  | object | all info that should always be collected when indexing any type interface |
| description (optional) | string | a string that is known to contain markdown. |
| commentsInside  | array |  |
| isExported  | boolean | boolean indicating whether or not this interface is exported from the file, and with that, from the operation |
| hasGeneric  | boolean | boolean indicating whether or not this interface uses one or more generic variables |
| rawText (optional) | string | raw interface text, coming from ts-morph |
| extensions (optional) | array | if the interface extends anything, names will be specified here |
| isDbModel  | boolean | If true, this interface is marked as a db model, which means it will be included in the db function autocompletion so it's easy to store and fetch data in this format.<br /><br />Is automatically set to true when indexing and when one of the following statements holds true<br /><br />- if the doc-comment contains frontmatter with `isDbModel` or `dbStorageMethod` specified<br />- if the interface last word is "db" or "model" and if there are minimum 2 words<br />- if the interface extends some other special interface |
| isOperationIndex  | boolean | If this is true, this is a db-model that is ALWAYS attached to an operation.<br /><br />By default this means it will get a folder in the `db` folder in the operation folder, where the interface will be stored linked to the file-id in specified folder.<br /><br />However, you can also specify a `storageLocationRelativeFilePath` if you want to store the model on an exact location relative to the operation root. |
| operationStorageLocationRelativeFilePath (optional) | string | If given, specify a file path here where the data should be stored. Must be an operation relative path.<br /><br />This will map onto the "operationRelativePath" for that instance.<br /><br />NB: Since this is a single file per project or per operation, it will overwrite your data in case of `jsonSingle` or `markdown` storage. |
| dbStorageMethod (optional) | string | The following strategies are available to store the data.<br /><br />- **jsonMultiple *(default)***: stores the data in a json file which is an array of this data structure. This file will be located in `db/[pluralized-kebab-case-model-name].json`<br /><br />- **jsonSingle**: stores the data in a json file which is of this data structure (single object) These files will be located in `db/[pluralized-kebab-case-model-name]/[instance-slug-or-id].json`<br /><br />- **markdown**: stores the data in a markdown file. Takes "markdown" parameter as the main markdown. The other parameters are stored as front-matter. This these files will be located in `db/[pluralized-kebab-case-model-name]/[instance-slug-or-id].md`<br /><br />- **keyValueMarkdown**: stores the data in key value markdown format. This file will be located in `db/[pluralized-kebab-case-model-name].md`<br /><br />- **csv**: stores the data in a csv file (only possible for flat object datastructures). This file will be located in `db/[pluralized-kebab-case-model-name].csv`<br /><br />## Definitions:<br /><br />- [pluralized-kebab-case-model-name]: e.g. `StudentUser` becomes `student-users`<br />- [instance-slug-or-id]: For all models with a slug parameter, the filename will be that slug of that instance. Otherwise, `id` will be used |
