 All right, so that were most of the features that we
 currently have in Tiberipo.
 But I also wanted to tell you a little more about what's
 going to come because we're
 not done yet.
 We're working very hard to make it something real and
 something big, something huge.
 And we are focused on making the best framework for
 startups, basically, to create their new
 ideas as soon as fast as possible with a very good
 developer experience.
 Because it's just usually a lot of problems that startups
 are solving, that every startup
 has to solve in almost the same way.
 And that's why I wanted to make this framework to really
 make it easier for startups to solve
 all those problems once and for all.
 So yeah, that's kind of the motivation behind it.
 And just to say something about Web3, from the ground up, T
iberipo has been built to
 support decentralized systems.
 We are experimenting a lot with this.
 We are doing a lot of peer-to-peer stuff.
 The API is built up in a way that it will be able to also
 be exposed from your own computer.
 And we will provide some tutorials for that later.
 It already works.
 We just need to finish the kind of the authorization and
 authentication layer.
 Because that's kind of not ready yet, which is kind of a
 big deal, you know.
 But once it will be ready, which will be pretty soon, I'll
 let you know and yeah.
 Hope to see some people make some stuff with this.
