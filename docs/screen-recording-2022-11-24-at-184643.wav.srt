1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,450
 is that you can automatically generate documentation of

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:07,440
 your code. When you write

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,520
 your code anywhere in your code base and you provide

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,880
 documents, the documentation

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,470
 will be generated for those functions based on the

6
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:21,040
 documents. Whenever you put

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:26,840
 a docs folder in your package, this will also end up in the

8
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,680
 Readme. So when you

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:34,720
 are done writing your documentation, all you need to do is

10
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,360
 rebuild the

11
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,720
 operation with the rebuild operation command and within a

12
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,920
 minute your docs

13
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,120
 will be generated and it will look something like this.

14
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:56,470
 This is the best way to generate docs I think because it

15
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,320
 really removes the

16
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,770
 need for doing it manually and it saves you a lot of time

17
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,600
 while keeping the docs

18
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,480
 always up to date with your code base.
