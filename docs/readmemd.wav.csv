13700, 15240, "going to come because we're"
15240, 17680, "not done yet."
17680, 21310, "We're working very hard to make it something real and"
21310, 23920, "something big, something huge."

32960, 37360, "ideas as soon as fast as possible with a very good"
37360, 39800, "developer experience."

45780, 49320, "are solving, that every startup"
49320, 51800, "has to solve in almost the same way."

100760, 106270, "We just need to finish the kind of the authorization and"
106270, 108760, "authentication layer."
108760, 112690, "Because that's kind of not ready yet, which is kind of a"
112690, 114360, "big deal, you know."
114360, 118660, "But once it will be ready, which will be pretty soon, I'll"
