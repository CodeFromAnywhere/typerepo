# ðŸ¦… A Birdseye View

## Philosophy

Typerepo was built with a couple of things in mind. This is what we care about:

- Codebase introspection (Documentation generation)
- Full-stack code-sharing (full-stack auto-completion using Typescript)
- Maximise learnability, minimise tech debt, simplify onboarding
- Decentralised, Open Source, Automatic

## The stack

We have templates to easly create new apps.

- For Web applications, [React](https://reactjs.org/) with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) is used
- For Android and iOS applications, [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) with [Expo](https://expo.dev) is used
- For REST APIs we use Server.js on Node JS
- For CLIâ€™s and Scripts we use raw Node JS
- There's also a bare javascript template you can use

We're planning to also make templates for the following:

- For MacOS, Windows and Linux applications, we want to use React with Electron
- For VSCode Extensions we want to use bare React!
- For Chrome Extensions we use React with [MV3](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/)

Together, this creates a very powerful setup. Typerepo isnâ€™t a single framework trying to build on multiple places. This would be very hard. Typerepo tries to keep all the good stuff and use the best framework for every location, and make it easy to share code.

### Used libraries

We use the following libraries in the Typerepo app.

#### React with Native

`react-with-native` is a framework that lets us render HTML-like components inside react-native. By replacing all html with the `react-with-native` counterparts (for example, using `<Div>` over `<div>`), we are able to share code between `react-native` and `react` and can share all UI between any app using our `ui` package. For more information, check https://reactwithnative.com/

#### Server.js

This Node.js server lets us define endpoints in a simpler way which made it possible to get type safety for the endpoints. For more information, check out https://serverjs.io

#### Tailwind

This layer on top of CSS is used within react-with-native and makes it possible to have the same styling in react and react-native apps. For more information, check https://tailwindcss.com

## Folder structure

Every Typerepo project must adhere the following structure:

- `apps` all applications, including a server, web, and mobile apps
- `packages` all packages that need to be shared between multiple apps
- `docs` markdown files that need to be presented in the Typerepo Docs to educate the developer of the project.
- `assets` any assets that don't belong to an app or package.
- `schemas` generated folder with the JSON typescript definitions
