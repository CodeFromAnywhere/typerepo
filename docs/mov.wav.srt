1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,460
 So if the front end generation is a step too far for you,

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:04,920
 you can also just use the very

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,380
 powerful API object of type repo.

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,730
 Every function on the backend that you create will be

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,160
 attached to the API object in the front

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,160
 end.

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,570
 So whenever you make a change in your backend code, it will

8
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:21,800
 immediately be available in the

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,400
 front end through the API object.

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,400
 Look at this.

11
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:31,100
 So the function sign up with password with context can be

12
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,000
 found here in the API object.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,810
 And it has almost the exact same footprint as the backend

14
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,720
 function except for that it

15
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,920
 doesn't have the function context.

16
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,590
 The function context is provided automatically by the API,

17
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,280
 by the fetch request function.

18
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,080
 So you only need to provide the parameters that you require

19
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:53,160
.

20
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,150
 And whenever you change something on the backend, it will

21
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:00,560
 also be seen in the API object.

22
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,850
 Another cool thing is that we have complete integration

23
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:05,560
 with React query through the

24
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,060
 queries object.

25
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:11,810
 So if you want to do an API call, for example, every time

26
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,560
 you go back to the page, you can

27
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,010
 just use the queries object and choose your hook that you

28
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:19,760
 want.

29
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:25,890
 For example, use get me with context will make sure that

30
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,160
 you get the locked in user and all

31
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,680
 their information every time you come back to the

32
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,960
 application.

33
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,110
 And you can also easily reload and all the other

34
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,400
 capabilities of React query.

35
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,700
 It comes out of the box and every function that you

36
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,560
 generate on the backend will generate

37
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,760
 automatically the hook and the API for you.

38
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,000
 (buzzing)
