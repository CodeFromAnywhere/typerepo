1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
 show you that this form is generated with the backend code.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,240
 The form is generated based

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,920
 on the backend function just by providing the right

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,960
 arguments. Another cool thing is

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,340
 asset upload. That's also included in type repo. If you

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,920
 provide an argument that ends

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,580
 with a certain suffix like image and if you provide the

8
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:24,480
 right type, it will become a picture

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,500
 upload in the form. You can select an image or you can take

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,560
 a picture here. Let's take

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:38,540
 a picture. I'm not going to show my camera. And after the

12
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,760
 picture has been taken and

13
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,610
 you start uploading, please note there is no code required

14
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:48,240
 for you at the front end. At

15
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,580
 the backend, there's also very little code required. All

16
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,040
 you need to do is this one line

17
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,790
 of code to process your assets and put it in the right

18
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:01,040
 place. You just take it and you

19
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:06,690
 process it and then you can put it wherever you want. So,

20
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,680
 asset upload has never been

21
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,440
 so easy.
