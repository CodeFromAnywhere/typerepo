 Alright
,
 so
 how
 to
 rebuild
.
 So
 it
's
 very
 important
 to
 rebuild
 your
 operation
.
 Well
,
 how
 is
 it
 easy
?
 You
 just
 run
 this
 command
 in
 the
 package
 where
 you
 are
.
 So
 that
's
 the
 answer
 to
 where
 and
 how
 I
 guess
.
 So
 as
 you
 can
 see
,
 I
'm
 now
 in
 the
 SMS
 package
.

 So
 let
's
 here
 and
 in
 order
 to
 rebuild
 this
 one
,
 I
 can
 just
 rebuild
 operation
 dot
.
 However
,
 if
 I
 were
 in
 the
 B
2
P
 folder
,
 I
 can
 run
 rebuild
 operation
 SMS
,
 right
?
 Because
 the
 folder
 SMS
 is
 located
 in
 the
 B
2
P
 folder
.
 So
 basically
 the
 argument
 of
 the
 rebuild
 operation
 CLI
 is
 the
 folder
 that
 you
 want
 to
 rebuild
,

 relatively
 to
 your
 current
 working
 directory
.
 So
,
 oh
,
 actually
,
 or
 it
's
 the
 name
 of
 the
 operation
.
 Sorry
,
 I
 forgot
 to
 specify
 the
 exact
 meaning
.
 So
 the
 exact
 meaning
 of
 the
 first
 argument
 is
 either
 a
 relative
 path
 to
 the
 folder
 of
 the
 operation
 or
 it
's
 just
 simply
 the
 name
 of
 the
 operation
.

 So
 in
 case
 I
 am
 anywhere
 else
,
 for
 example
 here
,
 I
 can
 rebuild
 operation
 SMS
 to
 rebuild
 SMS
 operation
.
 What
 this
 does
 and
 that
's
 the
 answer
 to
 your
 why
 question
 is
 it
 will
 create
 the
 database
 here
 for
 your
 operation
,

 which
 will
 index
 all
 the
 code
,
 all
 the
 type
 code
,
 and
 find
 all
 the
 imports
,
 all
 the
 exports
,
 all
 the
 comments
,
 all
 the
 build
 errors
,
 it
 indexes
 your
 operation
 with
 operation
 index
 and
 it
 finds
 all
 the
 variables
,
 all
 the
 interfaces
 and
 all
 the
 functions
.
 That
's
 the
 most
 important
,
 what
 it
 does
.

 And
 with
 that
 you
 can
 basically
 use
 that
 in
 order
 to
 do
 other
 things
,
 like
 make
 a
 form
,
 for
 example
,
 automatically
,
 because
 we
 have
 the
 index
 of
 the
 function
,
 we
 know
 exactly
 what
 the
 input
 is
 and
 what
 the
 output
 will
 be
.
 So
 this
 is
 why
 we
 need
 it
.
