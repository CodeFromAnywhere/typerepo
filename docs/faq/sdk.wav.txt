 Okay
,
 so
 let
's
 talk
 about
 the
 SDK
.
 So
 you
 can
 find
 the
 SDK
s
 in
 general
.
 Let
's
 talk
 in
 general
 first
.
 An
 SDK
 is
 basically
 it
 stands
 for
 Software
 Development
 Kit
.
 It
's
 kind
 of
 a
 collection
 of
 software
 development
 tools
 that
 are
 collected
 into
 one
 summar
ization
 of

 that
.
 So
 it
's
 one
 install
able
 package
 usually
 and
 they
 make
 it
 easier
 to
 create
 applications
 because
 they
 help
 the
 developer
 to
 have
 many
 tools
 in
 one
 single
 collection
.
 So
 this
 is
 called
 the
 Software
 Development
 Kit
 or
 SDK
.
 And
 the
 thing
 is
 with
 Type
R
ipper
 we
 create

 the
 SDK
 automatically
 with
 MP
X
 generates
 SDK
 operations
 or
 without
 the
 SDK
s
 if
 you
 have
 it
 installed
 without
 the
 MX
.
 So
 in
 the
 generated
 folder
 in
 any
 type
 repo
 you
 can
 find
 a
 lot
 of
 SDK
s
.
 So
 there
's

 SDK
,
 SDK
 API
,
 SDK
 API
 keys
,
 SDK
 DB
,
 blah
,
 blah
,
 blah
,
 blah
.
 So
 what
 you
 can
 just
 look
 into
 this
 folders
 and
 go
 to
 the
 file
 for
 every
 package
 in
 the
 source
 and
 then
 you
 can
 see
 what
's
 inside
.
 So
 most
 SDK
s
 that
 just
 summarize
 your
 whole
 code
base
.
 So
 for
 example
 in
 the
 API
,

 SDK
 API
 dot
 TS
 you
 will
 find
 a
 lot
 of
 imports
 and
 those
 imports
 are
 all
 the
 functions
 of
 your
 whole
 project
 and
 then
 it
 exports
 them
 again
 but
 it
 exports
 them
 inside
 of
 an
 object
 called
 SDK
.
 So
 that
's
 what
 it
 does
 and
 then
 SDK
 API
 keys
 it
 just
 summarizes
 the
 names
 of
 all

 the
 functions
 for
 example
.
 And
 then
 we
 also
 have
 SDK
 DB
 and
 that
 one
 it
 will
 import
 all
 the
 all
 the
 model
 types
 that
 have
 to
 be
 in
 the
 database
 and
 then
 it
 will
 kind
 of
 summarize
 them
 in
 inside
 of
 a
 big
 DB
 models
 type
 interface
.
 And
 also
 it
 will
 create
 some
 configuration
 that
 it
 found
 in
 kind
 of
 the
 documents
.
 And
 this
 is
 all
 automatically
 created
 in
 order
 for
 you
 to

 use
 the
 database
.
 It
 would
 not
 be
 possible
 without
 this
.
 And
 of
 course
 we
 can
 create
 it
 manually
 but
 the
 SDK
 generation
 makes
 it
 automatically
 for
 you
 because
 the
 index
ation
 is
 already
 there
 and
 that
 makes
 it
 a
 much
 easier
 developer
 experience
.
 So
 there
's
 also
 SDK
 and
 private
 and
 SDK
 and

 public
.
 It
's
 good
 to
 mention
 that
 those
 are
 kind
 of
 environment
 variables
 that
 you
 have
 set
 and
 you
 can
 set
 them
 there
 or
 you
 can
 set
 them
 somewhere
 else
.
 Like
 for
 example
 in
 a
 bundle
 configuration
 but
 you
 don
't
 have
 that
 package
.
 Yeah
 so
 there
's
 lots
 of
 different
 operations

 in
 the
 SDK
 operations
.
 There
's
 a
 lot
 of
 generated
 operations
 there
 and
 they
 all
 have
 a
 purpose
.
