 Okay
,
 so
 what
 is
 the
 mono
 repo
 and
 type
 repo
 and
 what
's
 the
 difference
 between
 them
?
 Well
,
 mono
 repo
 is
 a
 very
 general
 purpose
 idea
,
 it
's
 a
 concept
.
 Let
 me
 just
 do
 a
 quick
 search
 to
 give
 you
 a
 better
 definition
 than
 I
 can
 give
 you
.
 Mono
 repo
 is
 kind
 of
 a
 repository
 that
 holds
 many
 projects
.

 So
 it
's
 kind
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 smaller
 projects
 together
 in
 one
 repository
.
 They
 are
 related
 often
,
 but
 logically
 you
 can
 use
 them
 in
 an
 independent
 way
 and
 it
's
 also
 easier
 to
 divide
 code
 ownership
 between
 different
 team
 members
.
 So
 this
 is
 the
 advantage
 of
 a
 mono
 repo
.

 You
 can
 make
 a
 very
 big
 mono
 repo
 and
 still
 have
 a
 good
 overview
 of
 your
 code
.
 While
 if
 you
 would
 do
 it
 in
 one
 single
 package
,
 it
 would
 be
 very
 hard
 to
 get
 a
 good
 overview
 after
 a
 while
 because
 it
 would
 become
 too
 big
.
 So
 that
's
 the
 idea
 of
 a
 mono
 repo
.
 We
 create
 mono
 rep
os
 just
 because
 it
's
 more
 clear
 and
 more
 easy
 to
 overview
 and
 more
 easy
 to
 separate
 the
 different
 operations
 from
 each
 other
 and
 use
 them
 in
 different
 places
.

 So
 then
 what
 is
 a
 type
 repo
?
 A
 type
 repo
 is
 the
 mono
 repo
 that
 I
 created
,
 which
 is
 a
 second
 version
 of
 Sens
ible
.
 And
 it
 has
 a
 lot
 of
 kind
 of
 tools
 for
 the
 developer
 to
 make
 the
 mono
 repo
 easier
 to
 manage
.
 I
 think
 one
 of
 the
 biggest
 advantages
 that
 the
 type
 repo
 has
 that
 most
 mono
 rep
os
 don
't

 is
 an
 automatically
 generated
 SDK
 and
 also
 the
 index
ation
 of
 your
 operations
.
 Those
 two
 things
 they
 normally
 don
't
 happen
 for
 a
 default
 mono
 repo
,
 standard
 mono
 repo
.
 But
 yeah
,
 for
 the
 type
 repo
 that
 happens
 with
 the
 commands
,
 rebuild
 operation
 or
 rebuild

 all
 operations
 and
 then
 you
 can
 generate
 SDK
 with
 generate
 SDK
 operations
.
 And
 this
 is
 a
 very
 useful
 thing
 because
 compared
 to
 the
 normal
 mono
 repo
,
 you
 would
 have
 an
 SDK
 where
 it
 kind
 of
 summarizes
 your
 whole
 mono
 repo
 together
 and
 you
 can
 build
 on
 top

 of
 that
 so
 you
 can
 build
 on
 top
 of
 that
 because
 you
 can
 kind
 of
 create
 things
 with
 that
.
 Autom
atically
 create
 a
 form
 or
 maybe
 a
 database
 that
 summarizes
 everything
 across
 your
 whole
 mono
 repo
.
 And
 this
 way
 it
 becomes
 much
 easier
 to
 do
 things
 more
 quickly
 and
 that
's
 the
 advantage
 of
 the
 type
 repo
.
