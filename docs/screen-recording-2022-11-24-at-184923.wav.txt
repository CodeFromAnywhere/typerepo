 show you that this form is generated with the backend code.
 The form is generated based
 on the backend function just by providing the right
 arguments. Another cool thing is
 asset upload. That's also included in type repo. If you
 provide an argument that ends
 with a certain suffix like image and if you provide the
 right type, it will become a picture
 upload in the form. You can select an image or you can take
 a picture here. Let's take
 a picture. I'm not going to show my camera. And after the
 picture has been taken and
 you start uploading, please note there is no code required
 for you at the front end. At
 the backend, there's also very little code required. All
 you need to do is this one line
 of code to process your assets and put it in the right
 place. You just take it and you
 process it and then you can put it wherever you want. So,
 asset upload has never been
 so easy.
