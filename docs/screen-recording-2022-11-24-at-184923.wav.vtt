00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760
 show you that this form is generated with the backend code.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.240
 The form is generated based

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.920
 on the backend function just by providing the right

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.960
 arguments. Another cool thing is

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.340
 asset upload. That's also included in type repo. If you

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:16.920
 provide an argument that ends

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.580
 with a certain suffix like image and if you provide the

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.480
 right type, it will become a picture

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.500
 upload in the form. You can select an image or you can take

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.560
 a picture here. Let's take

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:38.540
 a picture. I'm not going to show my camera. And after the

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.760
 picture has been taken and

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.610
 you start uploading, please note there is no code required

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.240
 for you at the front end. At

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.580
 the backend, there's also very little code required. All

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.040
 you need to do is this one line

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.790
 of code to process your assets and put it in the right

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.040
 place. You just take it and you

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.690
 process it and then you can put it wherever you want. So,

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.680
 asset upload has never been

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.440
 so easy.
