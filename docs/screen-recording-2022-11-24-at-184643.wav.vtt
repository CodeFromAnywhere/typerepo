00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.450
 is that you can automatically generate documentation of

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.440
 your code. When you write

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.520
 your code anywhere in your code base and you provide

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.880
 documents, the documentation

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.470
 will be generated for those functions based on the

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.040
 documents. Whenever you put

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.840
 a docs folder in your package, this will also end up in the

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.680
 Readme. So when you

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.720
 are done writing your documentation, all you need to do is

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.360
 rebuild the

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.720
 operation with the rebuild operation command and within a

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.920
 minute your docs

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.120
 will be generated and it will look something like this.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:56.470
 This is the best way to generate docs I think because it

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.320
 really removes the

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.770
 need for doing it manually and it saves you a lot of time

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.600
 while keeping the docs

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.480
 always up to date with your code base.
