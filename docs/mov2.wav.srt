1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,560
 your type repo, it will start watching what you do in your

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:08,230
 codebase. And it will index your changes. So whenever I

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:08,520
 change

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,520
 some things in a function on the backend, I can use the

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:18,200
 indexed code to generate forms on the front end. Have a

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:18,440
 look.

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:24,720
 After a couple of seconds, you will see that the form will

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,520
 change on the front end after I made a change in the

9
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:27,840
 function

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,760
 on the backend. The front end and backend are super tightly

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,800
 integrated with type repo, and it's very easy to quickly

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,120
 generate front ends from your backend code.
