# Getting started

## Installation instructions `*`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CodeFromAnywhere/typerepo.git
cd typerepo
yarn
yarn dev
```

`*` = Make sure you have `node` 17+ (we are using the new fetch api)

## How does it work?

Well there's just too much to explain... I'll probably do some more demo's soon, but the most important is probably the following:

- Define endpoints (and other type interfaces) in a central place
- Write your endpoint with complete typesafety
- Call your endpoint with complete type-safety and autocompletion (no boilerplate needed!)
- If you need more help, just look in the auto-generated docs!

## The Core TypeRepo Philosophy

- Codebase introspection (Documentation generation)
- Full-stack code-sharing (full-stack auto-completion using Typescript)
- Maximise learnability, minimise tech debt, simplify onboarding
- Decentralised, Open Source, Automatic
