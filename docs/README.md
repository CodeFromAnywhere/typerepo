# Welcome

TypeRepo is a full stack typescript framework that lets you build apps super quickly and smoothly. TypeRepo lets you easily share your code between `React` and `React Native`, and between `front-end` and `back-end`. It has never been this easy! TypeRepo's mission is to boost the productivity of 100.000+ Software Developers, making it as easy as possible to build high-quality full-stack mobile- and web-apps.

## Installation instructions

1. Make sure you have `brew`, `node`, `npm` and `npx`. If you don't, this is how to install them:

/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

```
brew install node
```

2. clone this repo

```
git clone https://github.com/CodeFromAnywhere/typerepo.git
```

3. run `yarn` and `npx dev` to get developing!

## How does it work?

- Define endpoints (and other type interfaces) in a central place
- Write your endpoint with complete typesafety
- Call your endpoint with complete type-safety and autocompletion (no boilerplate needed!)
- If you need more help, just look in the auto-generated docs!

## The Core TypeRepo Philosophy

- Codebase introspection (Documentation generation)
- Full-stack code-sharing (full-stack auto-completion using Typescript)
- Maximise learnability, minimise tech debt, simplify onboarding
- Decentralised, Open Source, Automatic
