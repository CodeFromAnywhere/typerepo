00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760
 repoships with is the database integration.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.600
 We created our own database to make it as easy as possible

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.760
 for you to create your new models and make an app full of

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.040
 data.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.560
 We have this database user interface where you can see

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.800
 all your data, where you can create new models, where you

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.680
 can add updates and delete new instances.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.400
 You can view your models in different ways.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.800
 You can search your data and much more.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.480
 So if you want to create a new model in type repo, you don

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:39.560
't

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.880
 need to create anything hard.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.360
 It's just a TypeScript interface.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.680
 And that's it.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.160
 So you just extend a model type, you let it be indexed by

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.160
 type repo, and you can see it in your database.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.320
 So if I want to add something here, all I need to do is

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.760
 change the type interface, and the model is ready to be

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.320
 used.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.280
 Because the indexation, it's never been as easy as this to

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.400
 create or alter your database models.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:25.400
