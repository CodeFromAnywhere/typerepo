 your type repo, it will start watching what you do in your
 codebase. And it will index your changes. So whenever I
 change
 some things in a function on the backend, I can use the
 indexed code to generate forms on the front end. Have a
 look.
 After a couple of seconds, you will see that the form will
 change on the front end after I made a change in the
 function
 on the backend. The front end and backend are super tightly
 integrated with type repo, and it's very easy to quickly
 generate front ends from your backend code.
