00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 Okay, so now I will briefly also touch upon the other

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.300
 features that we're working very

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.500
 hard for the coming months.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.260
 First of all, test automation.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:16.210
 We are working on detecting certain function executions in

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:18.460
 the backend so that you can

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.230
 automatically choose which executions could be tests and

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.500
 then you can automatically test

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.500
 them.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.380
 We already have a user interface for that but it's still

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.460
 very experimental so it's not

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.460
 ready yet.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.240
 The second thing is which is kind of related, this

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.580
 execution monitoring so you can see all

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.990
 your functions that are executed on the backend and you can

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.100
 monitor the executions.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.490
 Also there is going to be which is one of the most

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.140
 important things actually.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.410
 There's going to be a monetization layer on top of type

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.180
 repo out of the box which means

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:00.150
 that for startups it's very easy to monetize anything you

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.860
 create.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.230
 That's going to really, really shorten your time to market

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:06.460
 because you don't have to

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.840
 build your own integration with something like Stripe

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.500
 because you just have to provide

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.960
 your token and then you can from the type repo user

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.600
 interface create your own settings

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.820
 for payments for different things.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.490
 That's something I'm very excited about but it's going to

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.540
 take a couple months at least.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.380
 Then the most important that we still didn't finish yet is

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.300
 the authentication and authorization

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.540
 layer.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.630
 That's something that really needs to be there in my

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.540
 opinion and it will help you to when

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.350
 you start a new project to immediately have login, sign up,

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.700
 two factor authentication,

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.260
 authorization, groups, roles, everything you want in a

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.180
 regular platform out of the box

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.260
 so that you don't have to reinvent the wheel.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.480
 Last but not least, we want to make it very easy for

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.540
 developers, for code creators to

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.180
 earn money with their code that they make.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.810
 We're going to build a code marketplace where you can

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.820
 create your own code and share it not

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:19.060
 only open source but also earn money with the code.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.620
 There are going to be multiple business models coupled to

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.380
 it so you can for example earn

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.620
 for a one-time fee when people buy your source or maybe you

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.420
 want to earn money by paying

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.820
 for execution.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.540
 These things are something we're working on right now.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.050
 These are some insights on the things we're still working

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.020
 on and in the coming months,

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.020
 these things will be added to type repo.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.020
 Hope you like it.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.820
 Let me know what you think and see you in the community.
