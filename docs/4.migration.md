# ➡️ Migrating to Typerepo

There's a lot of steps involved in migrating an existing codebase to start using Typerepo.

## Getting it to run

1. Clone the [repo](https://github.com/CodeFromAnywhere/typerepo)
2. Copy your apps to the `apps` folder, your `packages` to the `packages` folder.
3. Fix package versioning problems (you can just have one version per package, or you need to use [nohoist](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/blog/2018/02/15/nohoist/])
4. Ensure everything builds and can be rebuilt with `rebuildOperation`. If not, have a look at the conventions. The most common problem is that you are doing stuff in `index` files, which is not allowed.
5. Ensure the SDK can be generated with `generateSdkOperations`. If not, you have some problems in applying all conventions...

This may seem like a daunting task, and it probably is. If you need help, don't hestitate to [contact us](mailto:info@codefromanywhere.com). We would love to learn more about making migrations to Typerepo easier. We'll even help you for free to a certain point!
