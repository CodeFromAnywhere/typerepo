1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,970
 All right, so that were most of the features that we

2
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:10,800
 currently have in Tiberipo.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,700
 But I also wanted to tell you a little more about what's

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,240
 going to come because we're

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,680
 not done yet.

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,310
 We're working very hard to make it something real and

7
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,920
 something big, something huge.

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,740
 And we are focused on making the best framework for

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,960
 startups, basically, to create their new

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,360
 ideas as soon as fast as possible with a very good

11
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,800
 developer experience.

12
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:45,780
 Because it's just usually a lot of problems that startups

13
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,320
 are solving, that every startup

14
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,800
 has to solve in almost the same way.

15
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,520
 And that's why I wanted to make this framework to really

16
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,960
 make it easier for startups to solve

17
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:06,400
 all those problems once and for all.

18
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,600
 So yeah, that's kind of the motivation behind it.

19
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,030
 And just to say something about Web3, from the ground up, T

20
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,800
iberipo has been built to

21
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,320
 support decentralized systems.

22
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,200
 We are experimenting a lot with this.

23
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,880
 We are doing a lot of peer-to-peer stuff.

24
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,520
 The API is built up in a way that it will be able to also

25
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,480
 be exposed from your own computer.

26
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:39,600
 And we will provide some tutorials for that later.

27
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,760
 It already works.

28
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:46,270
 We just need to finish the kind of the authorization and

29
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,760
 authentication layer.

30
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,690
 Because that's kind of not ready yet, which is kind of a

31
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:54,360
 big deal, you know.

32
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,660
 But once it will be ready, which will be pretty soon, I'll

33
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,560
 let you know and yeah.

34
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,480
 Hope to see some people make some stuff with this.
