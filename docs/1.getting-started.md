# Getting started

There's quite a big learning curve for typerepo, so it's best to look at our live coding and tutorials first.

For now, I'll simply refer you to the youtube channel, but later I'm going to make a better tutorial. Coming soon.

# Setup

It is very useful to add the typerepo bin to your path, you can do so by adding something like this to your `~/.zshrc` or bashrc:

```bash
path+=('/path/to/typerepo/node_modules/.bin')
```

If you don't do this, you can access all cli's via `npx [command]` if you are somewhere in your typerepo folder. If you do this, you can access all commands from anywhere, using just the actual command in your terminal.
