WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.970
 All right, so that were most of the features that we

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.800
 currently have in Tiberipo.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.700
 But I also wanted to tell you a little more about what's

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.240
 going to come because we're

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.680
 not done yet.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.310
 We're working very hard to make it something real and

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.920
 something big, something huge.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.740
 And we are focused on making the best framework for

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.960
 startups, basically, to create their new

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.360
 ideas as soon as fast as possible with a very good

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.800
 developer experience.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.780
 Because it's just usually a lot of problems that startups

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.320
 are solving, that every startup

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.800
 has to solve in almost the same way.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.520
 And that's why I wanted to make this framework to really

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.960
 make it easier for startups to solve

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:06.400
 all those problems once and for all.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.600
 So yeah, that's kind of the motivation behind it.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.030
 And just to say something about Web3, from the ground up, T

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.800
iberipo has been built to

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.320
 support decentralized systems.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.200
 We are experimenting a lot with this.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.880
 We are doing a lot of peer-to-peer stuff.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.520
 The API is built up in a way that it will be able to also

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.480
 be exposed from your own computer.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.600
 And we will provide some tutorials for that later.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.760
 It already works.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.270
 We just need to finish the kind of the authorization and

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.760
 authentication layer.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.690
 Because that's kind of not ready yet, which is kind of a

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.360
 big deal, you know.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.660
 But once it will be ready, which will be pretty soon, I'll

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.560
 let you know and yeah.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.480
 Hope to see some people make some stuff with this.
