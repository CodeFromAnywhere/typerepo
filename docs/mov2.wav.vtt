00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560
 your type repo, it will start watching what you do in your

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.230
 codebase. And it will index your changes. So whenever I

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:08.520
 change

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.520
 some things in a function on the backend, I can use the

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:18.200
 indexed code to generate forms on the front end. Have a

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.440
 look.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:24.720
 After a couple of seconds, you will see that the form will

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.520
 change on the front end after I made a change in the

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:27.840
 function

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.760
 on the backend. The front end and backend are super tightly

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.800
 integrated with type repo, and it's very easy to quickly

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.120
 generate front ends from your backend code.
