1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
 repoships with is the database integration.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,600
 We created our own database to make it as easy as possible

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,760
 for you to create your new models and make an app full of

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,040
 data.

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,560
 We have this database user interface where you can see

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:23,800
 all your data, where you can create new models, where you

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,680
 can add updates and delete new instances.

8
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,400
 You can view your models in different ways.

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,800
 You can search your data and much more.

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,480
 So if you want to create a new model in type repo, you don

11
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:39,560
't

12
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,880
 need to create anything hard.

13
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,360
 It's just a TypeScript interface.

14
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,680
 And that's it.

15
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,160
 So you just extend a model type, you let it be indexed by

16
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:56,160
 type repo, and you can see it in your database.

17
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,320
 So if I want to add something here, all I need to do is

18
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,760
 change the type interface, and the model is ready to be

19
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,320
 used.

20
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,280
 Because the indexation, it's never been as easy as this to

21
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,400
 create or alter your database models.

22
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:25,400
