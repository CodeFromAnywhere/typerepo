5000, 6300, "features that we're working very"
6300, 9500, "hard for the coming months."
9500, 11260, "First of all, test automation."
11260, 16210, "We are working on detecting certain function executions in"
16210, 18460, "the backend so that you can"
18460, 22230, "automatically choose which executions could be tests and"
22230, 24500, "then you can automatically test"
24500, 25500, "them."
25500, 29380, "We already have a user interface for that but it's still"
29380, 31460, "very experimental so it's not"
31460, 32460, "ready yet."
32460, 35240, "The second thing is which is kind of related, this"
35240, 37580, "execution monitoring so you can see all"
37580, 41990, "your functions that are executed on the backend and you can"
41990, 44100, "monitor the executions."
44100, 46490, "Also there is going to be which is one of the most"
46490, 48140, "important things actually."
48140, 51410, "There's going to be a monetization layer on top of type"
51410, 53180, "repo out of the box which means"
53180, 60150, "that for startups it's very easy to monetize anything you"
60150, 60860, "create."
60860, 65230, "That's going to really, really shorten your time to market"
65230, 66460, "because you don't have to"
66460, 70840, "build your own integration with something like Stripe"
70840, 73500, "because you just have to provide"
73500, 76960, "your token and then you can from the type repo user"
76960, 79600, "interface create your own settings"
79600, 82820, "for payments for different things."
82820, 86490, "That's something I'm very excited about but it's going to"
86490, 88540, "take a couple months at least."
88540, 91380, "Then the most important that we still didn't finish yet is"
91380, 93300, "the authentication and authorization"
93300, 94540, "layer."
94540, 97630, "That's something that really needs to be there in my"
97630, 100540, "opinion and it will help you to when"
100540, 104350, "you start a new project to immediately have login, sign up,"
104350, 106700, "two factor authentication,"
106700, 110260, "authorization, groups, roles, everything you want in a"
110260, 112180, "regular platform out of the box"
112180, 116260, "so that you don't have to reinvent the wheel."
116260, 120480, "Last but not least, we want to make it very easy for"
120480, 122540, "developers, for code creators to"
122540, 126180, "earn money with their code that they make."
126180, 128810, "We're going to build a code marketplace where you can"
128810, 130820, "create your own code and share it not"
130820, 139060, "only open source but also earn money with the code."
139060, 142620, "There are going to be multiple business models coupled to"
142620, 144380, "it so you can for example earn"
144380, 150620, "for a one-time fee when people buy your source or maybe you"
150620, 153420, "want to earn money by paying"
153420, 154820, "for execution."
154820, 159540, "These things are something we're working on right now."
159540, 163050, "These are some insights on the things we're still working"
163050, 165020, "on and in the coming months,"
165020, 167020, "these things will be added to type repo."
167020, 169020, "Hope you like it."
169020, 171820, "Let me know what you think and see you in the community."
