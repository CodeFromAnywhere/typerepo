1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 is that once you start it up and when you are in the base

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,500
 of your mono repo, you get the search UI like this.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,080
 You can search all your projects with the search bar and

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,760
 you can select one of the apps that you made within your

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,500
 mono repo to use them.

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:23,710
 So here, for example, if we want to open up this operation,

7
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:28,000
 this web interface, we can just click and you see that it

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,500
 starts loading

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,640
 and open it in a new tab in your browser. It didn't even

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,200
 run before in your terminal because you don't need to start

11
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,500
 up your web interface

12
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,940
 since we started up for you in the background if you want

13
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:44,500
 to.

14
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:49,850
 So this way, it's very easy to basically run your apps and

15
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:53,360
 look them up fast if you want to make changes across

16
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,500
 different apps.

17
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,850
 It's perfect for developers that work on many different

18
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,500
 apps at the same time inside of a huge mono repo.
