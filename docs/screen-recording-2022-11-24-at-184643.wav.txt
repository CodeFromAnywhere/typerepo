 is that you can automatically generate documentation of
 your code. When you write
 your code anywhere in your code base and you provide
 documents, the documentation
 will be generated for those functions based on the
 documents. Whenever you put
 a docs folder in your package, this will also end up in the
 Readme. So when you
 are done writing your documentation, all you need to do is
 rebuild the
 operation with the rebuild operation command and within a
 minute your docs
 will be generated and it will look something like this.
 This is the best way to generate docs I think because it
 really removes the
 need for doing it manually and it saves you a lot of time
 while keeping the docs
 always up to date with your code base.
