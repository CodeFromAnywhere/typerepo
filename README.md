# Typerepo

Typerepo is a collection of tools, conventions and a large SDK that brings together the well-known frameworks such as Node.js, Expo.dev and Next.js under 1 bigger whole. By clever use of Typescript and bundle techniques, we have managed to share a lot of code between different frontends (app, web, extensions, electron) and also the front and backend. Besides this, our framework features automatic documentation, a CLI to get started in no-time, and a huge library of useful integrations.

The project is now in alpha, we are looking for developers trying to build startups and need a custom SaaS solution, to validate Typerepo.
