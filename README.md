# The developers platform for web3 has arrived

## As fast as no-code, as flexible as any other framework

**Typerepo** aims to make it as easy as possible to build high-quality full-stack mobile- and web-apps.

Typerepo is a collection of tools, conventions and a large SDK that brings together the well-known **Typescript** frameworks: **Node.js**, **Expo.dev** and **Next.js** under 1 bigger whole.

âœ… **Automatic form generation** Generate forms from your functions without writing any frontend code

âœ… **API generation** You don't need to write endpoints, just write your functions in the node environment and they will be accessible as CLI as well as through the API

âœ… **API type-safety** Your backend functions are directly accessible via the `api` object on the frontend. We also support `react-query` by creating a fully-typed `useQuery` for you for every backend-function, automatically.

âœ… **Automatic documentation** Everything you code automatically becomes part of your docs, no need to write them separately!

âœ… **Asset upload** You don't need to integrate to any third party services to allow asset upload, and there is no set up required! You can allow image upload at any page with a single line of code.

âœ… **Database** we created `typebase` to bring first-class support for anything we're still going to build.

âœ… **Admin panels** We bring all your code together in an admin panel where you can try out your functions and control all your data in the database.

âœ… **Web3 first** from the ground up, typerepo was built to support decentralised systems and peer to peer as a first-class citizen

ðŸŸ  **Test automation** We are building a different, better way to test your code

ðŸŸ  **Execution monitoring** Soon, you can see all the functions executed in your backend and monitor different things

ðŸŸ  **Monetisation** We're building an SDK to help you monetise your platform out of the box. We're planning on integrating with Stripe and Crypto!

ðŸŸ  **Authentication + Authorisation** We're building a general purpose auth layer that any app can use, out of the box!

ðŸŸ  **Code Marketplace** We're building the developers creator economy by enabling developers to earn money for their open source code more easily. No sponsorship, cold hard cash!

Many more things are coming!
