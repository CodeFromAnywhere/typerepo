/**
Searches filepaths, then links to any `ui-web` that has this file available as a page, or vscode.

For this we need to get the `MarkdownReaderPage` and other pages that are available in ui's and see the files they are linked to.

I want to be able to:

- search functions, interfaces, variables
- search operations
- search markdown files, anywhere
- search db-ui models

But there's more. To make a good serach...
