# ðŸ—„ db-web

`db-web` is the visual user interface for interacting with all available data in the typebase `fs-orm` database. It uses the `db-recipes` to show the available data in your project, and lets you CRUD it.

To start with this interface, you need to have `db-web` and `function-server` apps in your monorepo, ensure it's installed correctly, and run `yarn dev` inside of it. It can be a helpful tool to work with your data.
