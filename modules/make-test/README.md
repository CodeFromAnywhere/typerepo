# Functions

## isResultOfInterface

TODO: need validate-json-schema. also this can be its own little package, as it can be used in many other places

not sure if this should be part of make-test at all, because we want operations to be able to operate independently without the os, right? so then it won't work because you don't always have indexes...


### Returns: boolean

## makeTest

create a test that is testable with `runAllTests`...


### Returns: object
