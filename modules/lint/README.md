# Functions

## preIndexLint

Should be a collection of small functions that check if all conventions are used and if there isn't used anything that should NOT be used. this can later become a linter. make sure to research how eslint works first

Plan:

1) just use my own sdk's as much as possible to provide some handy convention checks in a package
2) later integrate this into vscode, i'm sure this is how it's done

this lint can be done before indexation
