# Timeline

timeline (`OperationClassification` ui-esm)


## ⏰ Timeline

- find statements in markdown (`> xxx`)
- find functions, interfaces, variables and show them
- find todos inside (doc) comments and the file around it
- find type build errors from typescript and the file around it
- show the above in a tik-tok kinda timeline that you can swipe (or click to enter the codebase)

This is a ui-esm operation. This means it's a ui operation that builds to javascript with ESM module resolving... It was based on this example: https://prateeksurana.me/blog/react-library-with-typescript/
