## TsComment

comments are basically one-or-multi-line human content inside of typescript files, so it's a very important to do something useful with them.

special line prefixes:
- TODO:
- DISCUSSION:
- IDEA:
- LATER:
- NB:

The convention should be that single-line comments should start with that. This then becomes the type of the comment. You can also put multiple prefixes at the start.

Example:

`// TODO: NB: this is a todo but its also important`

Multiline comments can also have one or multiple types in their text, but they should not be split into multiple comments as the context could be needed some times.



There are also some other things comments can say about statements, but these should be inside the frontmatter, and are much more flexible.
- classified[0-10] indicating level of classification. This way I can share subsets of the codebase, maybe...
- privacy
- ...?

NB: with the current setup we can also parse `.md` files as being a TsComment, keep it that way!

NB: comments are part of the code, so they should always be in English!

## TsInterface

TODO: Just like parameters, this should be linted for. If you define an interface that's not declared here, that should ring a bell.

| description (optional) | string | a string that is known to contain markdown. |
| commentsInside  | array |  |
| isExported  | boolean | boolean indicating whether or not this interface is exported from the file, and with that, from the operation |
| hasGeneric  | boolean | boolean indicating whether or not this interface uses one or more generic variables |
| rawText (optional) | string | raw interface text, coming from ts-morph |
| extensions (optional) | array | if the interface extends anything, names will be specified here |
| isDbModel  | boolean | If true, this interface is marked as a db model, which means it will be included in the db function autocompletion so it's easy to store and fetch data in this format.<br /><br />Is automatically set to true when indexing and when one of the following statements holds true<br /><br />- if the doc-comment contains frontmatter with `isDbModel` or `dbStorageMethod` specified<br />- if the interface last word is "db" or "model" and if there are minimum 2 words<br />- if the interface extends some other special interface |
| isOperationIndex  | boolean | If this is true, this is a db-model that is ALWAYS attached to an operation.<br /><br />By default this means it will get a folder in the `db` folder in the operation folder, where the interface will be stored linked to the file-id in specified folder.<br /><br />However, you can also specify a `storageLocationRelativeFilePath` if you want to store the model on an exact location relative to the operation root. |
| operationStorageLocationRelativeFilePath (optional) | string | If given, specify a file path here where the data should be stored. Must be an operation relative path.<br /><br />This will map onto the "operationRelativePath" for that instance.<br /><br />NB: Since this is a single file per project or per operation, it will overwrite your data in case of `jsonSingle` or `markdown` storage. |
| dbStorageMethod (optional) | string | The following strategies are available to store the data.<br /><br />- **jsonMultiple *(default)***: stores the data in a json file which is an array of this data structure. This file will be located in `db/[pluralized-kebab-case-model-name].json`<br /><br />- **jsonSingle**: stores the data in a json file which is of this data structure (single object) These files will be located in `db/[pluralized-kebab-case-model-name]/[instance-slug-or-id].json`<br /><br />- **markdown**: stores the data in a markdown file. Takes "markdown" parameter as the main markdown. The other parameters are stored as front-matter. This these files will be located in `db/[pluralized-kebab-case-model-name]/[instance-slug-or-id].md`<br /><br />- **keyValueMarkdown**: stores the data in key value markdown format. This file will be located in `db/[pluralized-kebab-case-model-name].md`<br /><br />- **csv**: stores the data in a csv file (only possible for flat object datastructures). This file will be located in `db/[pluralized-kebab-case-model-name].csv`<br /><br />## Definitions:<br /><br />- [pluralized-kebab-case-model-name]: e.g. `StudentUser` becomes `student-users`<br />- [instance-slug-or-id]: For all models with a slug parameter, the filename will be that slug of that instance. Otherwise, `id` will be used |
