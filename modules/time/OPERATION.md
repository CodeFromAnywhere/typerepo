# Tells the time at fixed timezone

Next step: https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/concepts/events-calendars

Integrate with Google Calendar API so I can easily see which events I have every day and set up an automatic reminder.

A good thing would be that it still allows people to invite me via google etc, it's easy to work with for VA's, and integrates with all other tools automatically. You can probably even add other calendars to it, like the one of microsoft and apple. Therefore it's a complete solution.

The amazing thing is I don't need to know the time anymore at any point (except maybe when underway)
