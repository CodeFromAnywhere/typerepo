## 📄 useStore (exported const)

NB: this is a `useStore` without a `StoreProvider`, because I think I won't ever need the provider since I won't ever need this as the sole storage in any component/app. If I do, I should make a provider, but it's usually better to create the `useStore` and `StoreProvider` in the component itself because it often comprises more than just this one.
