### Asset upload

If you want to use `sensible-asset`, you need to add it into a `typerepo`. Ensure that you convert your project into a `typerepo` first, if you don't have that already...

After that, all you need to do is add the `asset` folder to your project `packages`. Besides that, you can use it in your form by adding it as a plugin.

Now all you need to do is use the `AssetInput` anywhere you want to upload assets, and use the `processAsset` function if you want to put it somewhere.
