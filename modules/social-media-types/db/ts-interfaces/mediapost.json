This depends on the amount of identifyable items in the data What is the change of guessing an id? This depends on speed of a brute force attack and the amount of available datapoints. If you can guess 10000 times per second, you can make 864.000.000 guesses. A billion guesses on a dataset of a billion datapoints yields 3226 correct ids on average.\n\nWhy make an id short? I don't know if there's an important reason.\n\nAll in all, I think we should make ids 24 characters by default. This would make it very easy to store, yet, with more than E42 combinations, make it nearly impossible to get duplication or brute force hits.\n\nAn id would look like this:\n\n``` { \"id\": \"sk2EcW9AkZpksk2EcW9AkZpk\" } ```\n\nLooks good to me!
