# Functions

## findPostableToPost

This function finds a postable from the database and posts it on multiple channels

This can be executed with a CRON

1. finds a postable that has no posted paired
2. chooses the channels where this thing can be posted on
3. for every channel, formats the post correctly
4. for every channel, places the post




## updatePostedStatistics

This function keeps the `Posted` statistics up-to-date

Can be executed with a cron for all recent posts

| bundles  | array |  |
| dependencies  | array | Generated, private by default. If they're already here, uses private/public setting as given.<br /><br />When generating, removes the ones that are not dependencies (of dependencies) of your standalone apps |
| docsRelativeFolderPath (optional) | string | later this could be known by the frontend so it will render a ui to select a folder<br /><br />We need to figure out how we can know all type types in between when getting the type definition schema, not only the final type. If I'm lucky there is a way to find it as a #ref in a consistent way. |
| readmeRelativeFilePath (optional) | string |  |
| foldersFromRepo (optional) | array | if given, it will fetch these folders from the repo and paste them in the bundle whenever the bundle is generated<br /><br />can be handy if you're working with someone else... |



## BundleConfig

Configuration options for bundles. Used with `generateBundle`

Everything in this model will be copied over to the created bundle, except for `createBundleConfig` and `customisableBundleConfig`.

## Id

Should be an unique string By default, you can use `generateId()` to generate a random string of 16 characters. If you wish, you can also use any other string, as long as you are sure it's unique.


## Background Info

azAZ09 characters are easy to copy and provide 62 characters. the goal of an id is to be unique.

the advantage of a random id compared to an numeric id starting with 1 with auto increment is that you can set them up decentralised.

the change of duplicate ids gets bigger once you make them shorter the change of finding an existing id gets bigger once you make them shorter

An Id with 12 characters would provide 3.22e21 combinations.

What is the change of duplicate ids? This depends on the amount of identifyable items in the data What is the change of guessing an id? This depends on speed of a brute force attack and the amount of available datapoints. If you can guess 10000 times per second, you can make 864.000.000 guesses. A billion guesses on a dataset of a billion datapoints yields 3226 correct ids on average.

Why make an id short? I don't know if there's an important reason.

All in all, I think we should make ids 24 characters by default. This would make it very easy to store, yet, with more than E42 combinations, make it nearly impossible to get duplication or brute force hits.

An id would look like this:

``` { "id": "sk2EcW9AkZpksk2EcW9AkZpk" } ```

Looks good to me! Don't think about it and just keep it simple. We can always migrate later to a bigger amount, but I don't see good reason to keep it smaller than this.








## Language

all currently supported languages








## Location

locations are hierarchically categorized pieces of information.

a city can refer to the area, the area can refer the the country, the country to the continent, etc.

there are multiple ways to categorize it, but this depends on the application.

## MarkdownModelType

Handy model type for storing stuff in a Markdown file.

1 markdown file will represent 1 MarkdownModelType extended instance

another option could be to parse the markdown file, but to KISS we are going to just return markdown with the full markdown content

TODO: see how this relates to MarkdownFile. Make this very clear!

## Slug

use this for any identifier that's not an Id-type. Usually this is a kebab-case version of a written text, but it can also be a file path, for example.

> --- dbStorageMethod: jsonSingle<br />---<br /><br />Interface for arrow functions and normal functions

Properties: 

 | Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| operationName  | null | name of operation the model belongs to<br /><br />- calculated value (not stored in database)<br />- can be `null` or an actual operationName that it was saved at<br />- can be `undefined` when you are creating an item, because then it can be set for you |
| projectRelativePath  | string | path to dbfile<br /><br />- calculated value (not stored in database)<br />- relatively from the project (without slash at start)<br />- can be `undefined` when you are creating an item, because then it can be set for you |
| operationRelativePath (optional) | string | path to db file<br /><br />- relatively from the operation root folder (without slash at start)<br />- calculated value (not stored in database)<br />- can be `undefined` if the db file does not belong to an operation<br />- can be `undefined` when you are creating an item, because then it can be set for you |
| id  | string | unique id of the model |
| name  | string | name (identifier) of the model |
| slug  | string | kebab-case variant of the name |
| operationRelativeTypescriptFilePath  | string | relative file path from the operation that this indexed instance is referencing to<br /><br />e.g. src/general.ts<br /><br />(no preceding slash) |
| isExported  | boolean | The function is immediately exported upon creation. If the os dev tools are being used, this means it is also exported from the operation |
| isApiExposed  | boolean | for all exported functions in node operations, true by default false for others<br /><br />can be overwritten using frontmatter |
| apiAuthenticationStrategy  | string | Still not sure if the user one is a good idea but there are probably some usecases that would really benefit to have a user-layer embedded in the king os system |
| description (optional) | string | a string that is known to contain markdown. |
| rawText (optional) | string | raw text of the function |
| commentsInside  | array | all comments found in a function and the node that they belong to |
| returnType  | object | all info that should always be collected when indexing any type interface |
| parameters (optional) | array | parameters the function takes as its arguments, if any |
| size  | object | type interface that can be used to summarize multiple files |
| commentSize (optional) | object | type interface that can be used to summarize multiple files |
| codeSize (optional) | object | type interface that can be used to summarize multiple files |
| cumulativeSize (optional) | object | type interface that can be used to summarize multiple files |
| cumulativeCommentSize (optional) | object | type interface that can be used to summarize multiple files |
| cumulativeCodeSize (optional) | object | type interface that can be used to summarize multiple files |
| maxIndentationDepth  | number | maximum amount of times indedented in this function<br /><br />good for determining the complexity and finding code that can be simplified/destructured into smaller pieces |
| dependantFiles (optional) | array | finds all files that import this function<br /><br />NB: this is not indexed because this information has nothing to do with the operation itself, but the exposure to the broader monorepo. This is calculated on the fly. |



## TsInterface

TODO: Just like parameters, this should be linted for. If you define an interface that's not declared here, that should ring a bell.

| type  | object | all info that should always be collected when indexing any type interface |
| description (optional) | string | a string that is known to contain markdown. |
| commentsInside  | array |  |
| isExported  | boolean | boolean indicating whether or not this interface is exported from the file, and with that, from the operation |
| hasGeneric  | boolean | boolean indicating whether or not this interface uses one or more generic variables |
| rawText (optional) | string | raw interface text, coming from ts-morph |
| extensions (optional) | array | if the interface extends anything, names will be specified here |
| isDbModel  | boolean | If true, this interface is marked as a db model, which means it will be included in the db function autocompletion so it's easy to store and fetch data in this format.<br /><br />Is automatically set to true when indexing and when one of the following statements holds true<br /><br />- if the doc-comment contains frontmatter with `isDbModel` or `dbStorageMethod` specified<br />- if the interface last word is "db" or "model" and if there are minimum 2 words<br />- if the interface extends some other special interface |
| isOperationIndex  | boolean | If this is true, this is a db-model that is ALWAYS attached to an operation.<br /><br />By default this means it will get a folder in the `db` folder in the operation folder, where the interface will be stored linked to the file-id in specified folder.<br /><br />However, you can also specify a `storageLocationRelativeFilePath` if you want to store the model on an exact location relative to the operation root. |
| operationStorageLocationRelativeFilePath (optional) | string | If given, specify a file path here where the data should be stored. Must be an operation relative path.<br /><br />This will map onto the "operationRelativePath" for that instance.<br /><br />NB: Since this is a single file per project or per operation, it will overwrite your data in case of `jsonSingle` or `markdown` storage. |
| dbStorageMethod (optional) | string | The following strategies are available to store the data.<br /><br />- **jsonMultiple *(default)***: stores the data in a json file which is an array of this data structure. This file will be located in `db/[pluralized-kebab-case-model-name].json`<br /><br />- **jsonSingle**: stores the data in a json file which is of this data structure (single object) These files will be located in `db/[pluralized-kebab-case-model-name]/[instance-slug-or-id].json`<br /><br />- **markdown**: stores the data in a markdown file. Takes "markdown" parameter as the main markdown. The other parameters are stored as front-matter. This these files will be located in `db/[pluralized-kebab-case-model-name]/[instance-slug-or-id].md`<br /><br />- **keyValueMarkdown**: stores the data in key value markdown format. This file will be located in `db/[pluralized-kebab-case-model-name].md`<br /><br />- **csv**: stores the data in a csv file (only possible for flat object datastructures). This file will be located in `db/[pluralized-kebab-case-model-name].csv`<br /><br />## Definitions:<br /><br />- [pluralized-kebab-case-model-name]: e.g. `StudentUser` becomes `student-users`<br />- [instance-slug-or-id]: For all models with a slug parameter, the filename will be that slug of that instance. Otherwise, `id` will be used |
