If that is not possible, `ui-esm` is preferred for the frontend, or `node-esm` for things that require backend.\n\nTODO: It would be great to learn more about this topic and see if I can make more cross-environment packages. A great use case would be to create a wrapper around the current `fs-orm` to enable using it at the frontend too.\n\n# Possible values\n\nFULL STACK\n\n- `cjs`: only js (no node) (well, ts of course, but it gets built into common js)\n\n- `ts`: non-built typescript code (needs to be transpiled, not recommended)\n\nTODO: `esm`: builds to ESM module resolved Javascript\n\nFRONTEND ONLY (cannot be used within backend-only operations)\n\n- `ui-web`: has next.config.js and thus exposes something on some port when it is ran. next.js + react-based...\n\n- `ui-app`: uses react-native and exposes something on some port when it is ran\n\n- `ui-ts`: uses react (with (native)), which main entry points to typescript es6 files (this ui package cannot be built, should be transpiled. Primarily used for big ui libraries tied to a `ui-web` and `ui-app` for convenience. For other things, it is highly discouraged, please use `ui-cjs` or `ui-esm`)\n\n- `ui-cjs`: ui which main entry points to javascript es5 files (this ui package can be built). don't import ESM packages in here, this may give problems.\n\n- `ui-esm`: ui which builds to ESM module resolved Javascript. All packages that use `ui-esm` packages, need to be `ui-esm`, `ui-es6`, `ui-web`, or `ui-app` in order to work properly. It seems to have difficulties using this in `ui-cjs`\n\nBACKEND ONLY (cannot be used within frontend-only operations)\n\n- `node-cjs`: includes other node packages, operations, core-imports, and globals.\n\nTODO: `node-esm`: Typescript package that is built to ESM Javascript which also includes all node packages, operations, core-imports and globals.\n\nTODO: `node-ts`: transpilable node package\n\n- `server-cjs`: exposes something on some port when it is ran and uses node code\n\n# Indexation\n\nOperations will be classified automatically. It is good to remember that:\n\n- It will be classified as UI if `isUiOperation` resolves to true\n- It will be classified as Node if `Operation` has a (dev)dependency on `@types/node`.\n- Otherwise, it will be classified as base typescript (full stack)\n- It will be classified to an ESM operation if `tsconfigCompilesEsm` resolves to true.\n- It will be classified to a TS operation if `packageCompilesTs` resolves to true\n- In order for it to be classified as a server, you must set `isNodeServer` to true in the `.operation` config object of `Operation`",
