## README

## Creating an app template

Please note you can't add `package.json` and `.gitignore` files to templates! Call them `package.template.json` and `.gitignore.template` repectively in order for everything to function as expected (they will be renamed on installation)


# Functions

## getAvailableOperationName()

returns folder name

finds the first foldername that is available in this folder but also there is nowhere an operation already with this name

there is also getAvailableFolderPath for non-operation folders


| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| rootFolderPath | string |  |,| preferredFolderName | string |  |,| manualProjectRoot (optional) | string |  |
| **Output** |    |    |



## getOperationConfig()

Either finds the operation config in the database or creates a new one

NB: it does not push it into the database yet because the operation might not exist yet


| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| operationName | string |  |,| description (optional) | string | If you want to create one, set a description here. |
| **Output** |    |    |



## main()

| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| - | | |
| **Output** |    |    |



## newOperationWithFiles()

Creates a new operation with files with content

Returns the final operation base path (or undefined if something went wrong)

NB: relative paths must be relative to OPERATION ROOT, not src root! They must also lead to files in src, this thing is still buggy otherwise!

TODO: Remove the buggyness


| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| operationConfig | `OperationConfig` |  |,| srcFileContentObject | { [key: string]: string } | NB: relative paths must be relative to OPERATION ROOT, not src root! |,| config (optional) | { manualProjectRoot?: string, <br />destinationPath?: string, <br />overwriteIfExists?: boolean, <br />skipYarnInstall?: boolean, <br />skipYarnBuild?: boolean, <br />dryrun?: boolean, <br /> } |  |
| **Output** |    |    |



## newOperation()

## How to create a package/operation?

This cli creates the correct tsconfig.json, package.json, .gitignore, folder setup, so you can get started immedeately.

Returns either the `operationBasePath` of the created operation, or undefined if something went wrong


| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| name (optional) | string |  |,| config (optional) | { type?: `OperationClassification`, <br />operationConfig?: `OperationConfig`, <br />description?: string, <br />destinationPath?: string, <br />manualProjectRoot?: string, <br /> } |  |
| **Output** |    |    |



## newTemplate()

Returns either the `basePath` of the created template, or undefined if something went wrong


| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| type | string |  |,| destinationPath (optional) | string |  |
| **Output** |    |    |
