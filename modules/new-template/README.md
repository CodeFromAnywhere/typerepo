## Creating an app template

Please note you can't add `package.json` and `.gitignore` files to templates! Call them `package.template.json` and `.gitignore.template` repectively in order for everything to function as expected (they will be renamed on installation)


# Api reference

## getOperationConfig()

Either finds the operation config in the database or creates a new one

NB: it does not push it into the database yet because the operation might not exist yet


| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| operationName | string |  |,| description (optional) | string | If you want to create one, set a description here. |
| **Output** |    |    |



## newOperationWithFiles()

Creates a new operation with files with content

Returns the final operation base path (or undefined if something went wrong)

NB: relative paths must be relative to OPERATION ROOT, not src root! They must also lead to files in src, this thing is still buggy otherwise!

TODO: Remove the buggyness

| ---------- | -- | -- |
