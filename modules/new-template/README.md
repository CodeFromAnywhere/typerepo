  ## Creating an app template

Please note you can't add `package.json` and `.gitignore` files to templates! Call them `package.template.json` and `.gitignore.template` repectively in order for everything to function as expected (they will be renamed on installation)

## newOperationWithFiles()

Creates a new operation with files with content

Returns the final operation base path (or undefined if something went wrong)

NB: relative paths must be relative to OPERATION ROOT, not src root! They must also lead to files in src, this thing is still buggy otherwise!
